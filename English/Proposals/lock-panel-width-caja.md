# Suggestion: Lock panel width in split view mode in Caja

## Introduction

Currently, when working in split view mode in Caja, the width of the left and right panels automatically adjusts based on the path length shown in the location bar. This causes the panels to expand or shrink unexpectedly when navigating through folders with long names.

## Proposal description

I propose implementing an option to manually lock the width of each panel in split view mode.

Once the user sets the desired width, it should remain fixed regardless of changes in the path, window size, or content.

## Expected benefits

- Greater visual and organizational stability when navigating in dual-panel mode.
- Reduced distractions and unexpected panel movements.
- Improved user experience and efficiency, especially when handling large file systems or parallel tasks.
