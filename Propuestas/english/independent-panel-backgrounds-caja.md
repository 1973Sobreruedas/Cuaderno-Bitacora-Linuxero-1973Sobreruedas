# Suggestion: Independent panel backgrounds and simultaneous Caja profiles

## Introduction

Currently, Caja only allows setting a single background image that applies globally to the entire navigation window.

When working in dual-panel (split view) mode, both panels share the same background, making it harder to distinguish between different work contexts.

Additionally, Caja does not support independent profile systems that would allow running multiple instances simultaneously with separate configurations.

## Proposal description

### Part 1: Independent panel backgrounds

Allow configuring a different background image for each panel in split view mode.

This could be achieved by:
- Manual background selection per panel.
- Or automatic assignment based on the navigation path (e.g., light background for project folders, dark background for personal files).

### Part 2: Evaluate simultaneous profiles

Explore the possibility of allowing different Caja profiles to run simultaneously, each with its own:
- Appearance
- Extensions
- Behavior

Thus, it would be possible to open two completely independent Caja windows.

## Expected benefits

- Better visual distinction when managing parallel tasks.
- Greater flexibility for advanced users.
- Increased productivity and organization in complex work environments.
